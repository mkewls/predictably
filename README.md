# Predictably Politics!

Welcome to a small little app that is meant to provide a quick example of how a simple \
Bayesian machine learning model can be implemented in the area of voter analysis. Specifically \
this app leverages a collaborative filtering method rooted in matrix factorization, as \
helpfully abstracted by the Likely.js library for Node https://www.npmjs.com/package/likely. \
So, while this isn't a perfect app, I hope that the fundamental application of machine \
learning concepts to something as important as the election of the U.S. President is \
made more clear.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Open db/seedData.js and adjust the NUM_VOTERS constant to your desired number of voters!
```
npm install
npm start

```
4. Go Predict Voter Issue Sentiment!

## Purpose

This is an obviously over-simplified version of how machine learning has made its way \
into the predictive analytics used by political campaigns. For a brief and introductory \
overview of this topic and to see this app in action, please watch my Fullstack Academy \
tech talk here:  https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZY6_3nS4WM
